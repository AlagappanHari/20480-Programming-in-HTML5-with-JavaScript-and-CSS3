# Module 11: Creating Advanced Graphics

# Lesson 1: Creating Interactive Graphics by Using SVG

### Demonstration: Using SVG Transformations and Events

#### Preparation Steps 

1. Ensure that you have cloned the 20480C directory from GitHub. It contains the code segments for this course's labs and demos. https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/20480-Programming-in-HTML5-with-JavaScript-and-CSS3/tree/get_started/Allfiles.

#### Demonstration Steps

#### Transform SVG Elements

1.	On the Windows 10 **Start** screen, click the **Desktop** tile.
2.	On the Windows taskbar, click **Microsoft Edge**.
3.	In Microsoft Edge, open the file **Allfiles\Mod11\Democode\SvgDocument.html**. 
4.	If a message box appears asking if you want to allow blocked content, click the **Allow blocked content** button.
5.	In Microsoft Edge, click the **Transformations** button.
6.	Right-click the web page in Microsoft Edge, and then click **View source**.
7.	In the source window, locate the &lt;!-- Demonstrate transformations --&lt; comment and review the **&lt;svg&gt;** element: 
o	The <transform> elements translate the square by 200 units in the X and Y axes, scale it by a factor of 0.5, and rotate it.
8.	Close the source window.

#### Handle Events on SVG Elements

1.	In Microsoft Edge, click the **Events** button.
2.	Hover the mouse over the red shape on the left side of the window. Verify that the shape changes to a yellow fill color and a dotted green border.
3.	Move the mouse off the shape. Verify that it reverts to a red fill color with no outline.
4.	Hover the mouse over the blue shape on the right side of the window. Verify that the shape changes to a yellow fill color and a dotted green border.
5.	Move the mouse off the shape. Verify that it reverts to a blue fill color with no outline.
6.	Click the red shape. Verify that a message box appears, indicating that the shape represents Alaska. Close the message box.
7.	Click the blue shape. Verify that a message box appears, indicating that the shape represents Hawaii. Close the message box.
8.	Right-click in the browser window, and then click **View source**. 
9.	In the source window, locate the **&lt;!-- Demonstrate events --&gt;** comment and review the **&lt;svg&gt;** element:
- The **&lt;path&gt;** elements contain the data that defines the two maps.
- Each **&lt;path&gt;** element responds to the **onmousedown** event and uses JavaScript code to display the appropriate message.
10.	In the source window, locate the **path:hover** CSS rule near the top of the document. This CSS rule defines the style for all **&lt;path&gt;** elements when the user hovers over them with the mouse. 
11.	Close the source window.
12.	Close Microsoft Edge.

# Lesson 2: Drawing Graphics by Using the Canvas API

### Demonstration: Performing Transformations by Using the Canvas API

#### Preparation Steps 

1. Ensure that you have cloned the 20480C directory from GitHub. It contains the code segments for this course's labs and demos. https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/20480-Programming-in-HTML5-with-JavaScript-and-CSS3/tree/get_started/Allfiles.

#### Demonstration Steps

#### Perform Simple Transformations

1.	On the Windows 10 **Start** screen, click the **Desktop** tile.
2.	On the Windows taskbar, click **Microsoft Edge**.
3.	In Microsoft Edge, open the file **Allfiles\Mod11\Democode\CanvasDocument.html**. 
4.	If a message box appears asking if you want to allow blocked content, click the **Allow blocked content** button.
5.	In Microsoft Edge, click the **Separate Transformations** button.
6.	Right-click the web page in Microsoft Edge, and then click **View source**.
7.	In the source window, locate the **demoSeperateTransformations** function and review the code: 
- The **demoSeperateTransformations** function uses the **drawShape** function to draw a triangle filled with an image of the Welsh flag.
- Before calling the drawShape function, the code transforms the context; it moves the canvas to the right and down by half the width and height of the canvas, then it scales the context by a different value in the X and Y dimensions, and then rotates the context by PI/4 radians.
- When the **drawShape** function is called, the image is transformed according to the context settings.

>**Note:** If time allows, comment out each of the transformations and run the code again. Then uncomment each transformation one at a time, so that students can see the effects of each one.

#### Perform Matrix Transformation

1.	In Microsoft Edge, click the **Matrix Transformations** button.
2.	In the source window, locate the **demoMatrixTransformations** function and review the code: 
- This function is similar to the previous one in that it transforms the context and then calls the **drawShape** function to display the image.
- The difference is that this function uses the **transform** function to perform a matrix transformation, scaling, skewing, and translating the context in a single function call.
3.	Close the source window.
4.	Close Microsoft Edge.
