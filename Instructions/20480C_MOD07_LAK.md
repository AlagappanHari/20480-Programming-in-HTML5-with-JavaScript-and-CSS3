# Module 7: Creating Objects and Methods by Using JavaScript.

# Lab: Refining Code for Maintainability and Extensibility.

### Lab Setup

### Preparation Steps

1.	Ensure that you have cloned the 20480C directory from GitHub. It contains the code segments for this course's labs and demos. https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/20480-Programming-in-HTML5-with-JavaScript-and-CSS3/tree/get_started/Allfiles.

### Exercise 1: Object Inheritance.

#### Task 1: Review the Object.inherit.js JavaScript file.

1.	On the Windows 10 **Start** screen, click the **Visual Studio 2017** tile.
2.	In Visual Studio, on the **File** menu, point to **Open**, and then click **Project/Solution**.
3.	In the **Open Project** dialog box, browse to **Allfiles\Mod07\Labfiles\Starter\Exercise 1**, click **ContosoConf.sln**, and then click **Open**.
4.	In Solution Explorer, expand the **ContosoConf** project node, and then expand the **scripts** folder. 
5.	Double-click **Object.inherit.js**.
6.	Verify that the file contains the following JavaScript code:
    ```javascript
        var copyOwnProperties = function (from, to) {
            for (var propertyName in from) {
                if (from.hasOwnProperty(propertyName)) {
                    to[propertyName] = from[propertyName];
                }
            }
        };

        var inherit = function (additionalProperties) {
            ... 
        };
    ```

#### Task 2: Implement the Inherit function.

1.	In **Object.inherit.js**, find the following comment:
    ```javascript
        // TODO: Create a variable named `factory`, assign it a new object who's prototype is `this`.
    ```
2.	After the comment, add the following JavaScript code:
    ```javascript
        var factory = Object.create(this);
    ```
3.	Find the following comment:
    ```javascript
        // TODO: Add a method called `create` to `factory`, that does the following
    ```
4.	After the comment, add the following JavaScript: code:
    ```javascript
        factory.create = function() {
    ```
5.	Find the following comment:
    ```javascript
        // TODO: return `instance`.
    ```
6.	After the comment, add a blank line followed by the following JavaScript code:
    ```javascript
        };
    ```
7.	Find the following comment:
    ```javascript
        // TODO: Copy properties of `additionalProperties` onto `factory' (using 
        copyOwnProperties).
    ```
8.	After the comment, add the following JavaScript code:
    ```javascript
        copyOwnProperties(additionalProperties, factory);
    ```
9.	Find the following comment:
    ```javascript
        // TODO: Return the `factory` object.
    ```
10.	After the comment, add the following JavaScript code:
    ```javascript
        return factory;
    ```
11.	In the **inherit** function, find the comment that starts with the following line: 
    ```javascript
        // TODO: Define a variable named `instance`.
    ```
12.	After the comment, add the following JavaScript code:
    ```javascript
        var instance = Object.create(factory);
    ```
13.	Find the following comment: 
    ```javascript
        // TODO: If `instance` has a function named "initialize",
    ```
14.	After the comment, add the following JavaScript code:
    ```javascript
        if (typeof instance.initialize === "function") {
            instance.initialize.apply(instance, arguments);
        }
    ```
15.	Find the following comment: 
    ```javascript
        // TODO: return `instance`.
    ```
16.	After the comment, add the following JavaScript code:
    ```javascript
        return instance;
    ```
17.	Find the following comment: 
    ```javascript
        // TODO: Add the inherit function to the built-in `Object` object.
    ```
18.	After the comment, add the following of JavaScript code:
    ```javascript
        Object.inherit = inherit;
    ```

#### Task 3: Scope the JavaScript code inside an immediately invoked function expression.

1.	In **Object.inherit.js**, add the following JavaScript code at the top of the file:
    ```javascript
        (function () {
    ```
2.	Add the following JavaScript code at the end of the file:
    ```javascript
        } ());
    ```

#### Task 4: Use strict mode.

1.	In **Object.inherit.js**, find the following comment:
    ```javascript
        // TODO: Strict mode
    ```
2.	After the comment, add the following line (including the quotes):
    ```javascript
        "use strict";
    ```
3.	On the **File** menu, click **Save All**.

>**Results:** After completing this exercise, you will have written the **Object.inherit** utility function that you will use in later exercises to structure the code for the web application. You will also have modified the scope for this function, and specified that the code should run by using strict mode.

### Exercise 2: Refactoring JavaScript Code to Use Objects.

#### Task 1: Define the ScheduleList factory.

1.	In Visual Studio, on the **File** menu, point to **Open**, and then click **Project/Solution**.
2.	In the **Open Project** dialog box, browse to **Allfiles\Mod07\Labfiles\Starter\Exercise 2**, click **ContosoConf.sln**, and then click **Open**.
3.	Expand the **ContosoConf** project, expand the **scripts** folder, and then expand the **pages** folder.
4.	Double-click **schedule.js**.
5.	Find the following comment:
    ```javascript
        // TODO: Create a ScheduleList factory object using the Object.inherit helper method.
    ```
6.	After the comment, add the following JavaScript code:
    ```javascript
        var ScheduleList = Object.inherit({
            initialize: function (element, localStarStorage) {
                this.element = element;
                this.localStarStorage = localStarStorage;
            }
        });
    ```
7.	Find the comment that starts with the following line:
    ```javascript
        // TODO: Refactor these variables into properties of the ScheduleList object.
    ```
8.	Delete the following line of JavaScript code after this comment:
    ```javascript
        var element, localStarStorage;
    ```

#### Task 2: Convert functions into methods of the ScheduleList object.

1.	In **schedule.js**, find the following comment:
    ```javascript
        // TODO: Refactor these functions into methods of the ScheduleList object.
    ```
2.	Delete the **startDownload**, **downloadDone**, **downloadFailed**, **addAll**, and **add** functions that follow this comment.
3.	Add the following JavaScript code shown in bold to the **ScheduleList** object (note that there is a comma after the closing brace of the **initialize** function):
    ```javascript
        var ScheduleList = Object.inherit({
            initialize: function (element, localStarStorage) {
                this.element = element;
                this.localStarStorage = localStarStorage;
            },

            startDownload: function () {
                var request = $.ajax({
                    url: "/schedule/list",
                    context: this
                });
                request.done(this.downloadDone)
                       .fail(this.downloadFailed);
            },

            downloadDone: function (responseData) {
                this.addAll(responseData.schedule);
            },

            downloadFailed: function () {
                alert("Could not retrieve schedule data at this time. Please try again      later.");
            },

            addAll: function (itemsArray) {
                itemsArray.forEach(this.add, this);
            },

            add: function (itemData) {
                var item = ScheduleItem.create(itemData, this.localStarStorage);
                this.element.appendChild(item.element);
            }
        });
    ```

#### Task 3: Create and use a ScheduleList object.

1.	In **schedule.js**, find the following JavaScript code:
    ```javascript
        // TODO: Replace the following code by creating a ScheduleList object 
        //       and calling the startDownload method.
        element = document.getElementById("schedule");
        localStarStorage = LocalStarStorage.create(localStorage);
        startDownload();
    ```
2.	Delete this block of JavaScript code,  and then replace it with the following code:
    ```javascript
        var scheduleList = ScheduleList.create(
            document.getElementById("schedule"),
            LocalStarStorage.create(localStorage)
        );
        scheduleList.startDownload();
    ```

#### Task 4: Test the application.

1.	In Solution Explorer, double-click **schedule.htm**.
2.	On the **Debug** menu, click **Start Without Debugging**.
3.	In Microsoft Edge, if the message **Intranet settings are turned off by default** appears, click **Don’t show this message again**.
4.	Verify that the page looks similar to the image below:

![alt text](./Images/20480B_7_Schedule-Refactored.png "The Schedule page")

5.	Close Microsoft Edge.

>**Results:** After completing this exercise, you will have refactored the JavaScript code for the Schedule page to be more maintainable by using objects.
