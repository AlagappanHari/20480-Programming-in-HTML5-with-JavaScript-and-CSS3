1.	Start the **MSL-TMG1** virtual machine if it is not already running.
2.	Start the **20480C-SEA-DEV11** virtual machine if it is not already running.
3.	Log on to the **20480C-SEA-DEV11** virtual machine as **Student** with the password **Pa$$w0rd**.

>**Note:** If necessary, click **Switch User** to display the list of users.

4.	On the Windows 8 **Start** screen, click the **Visual Studio 2017** tile.
5.	In Visual Studio, on the **File** menu, point to **Open**, and then click **Project/Solution**.
6.	In the **Open Project** dialog box, browse to **Allfiles\Mod14\Labfiles\Starter\Exercise 1**, click **ContosoConf.sln**, and then click **Open**.
7.	In Solution Explorer, expand the **ContosoConf** project, and then double-click **speaker-badge.htm**.
8.	Verify that the page contains the following HTML markup:
    ```javascript
        <script src="/scripts/grayscale.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
    ```
9.	In Solution Explorer, expand the **scripts** folder, and then double-click **grayscale.js**.
10.	Verify that the file contains the following JavaScript function:
    ```javascript
        conference.grayscaleImage = function (image) {
            // Converts a colour image into gray scale.

            var deferred = $.Deferred();

            var canvas = createCanvas(image);
            var context = canvas.getContext("2d");
            var imageData = getImageData(context, image);

            // TODO: Create a Worker that runs /scripts/grayscale-worker.js

            var pixels = imageData.data;
            // 4 array items per pixel => Red, Green, Blue, Alpha
            for (var i = 0; i < pixels.length; i += 4) {
                grayscalePixel(pixels, i);
            }

            // Update the canvas with the gray scaled image data.
            context.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
            context.putImageData(imageData, 0, 0);

            // Returning a jQuery Deferred makes this function easy to chain together with other deferred operations.
            // The canvas object is returned as this can be used like an image.
            deferred.resolveWith(this, [canvas]);
            return deferred;
        };
    ```

#### Task 2: Convert the speaker badge image to grayscale.

1.	In Solution Explorer, in the **scripts** folder, expand the **pages** folder, and then double-click **speaker-badge.js**.
2.	In **speaker-badge.js**, find the following comment:
    ```javascript
        // TODO: Add grayscaleImage into the processing pipeline.
    ```
3.	Modify the code following this comment, as shown below in bold:
    ```javascript
        this.readFile(file)
            .pipe(this.loadImage)
            .pipe(grayscaleImage)
            .done(this.drawBadge, this.notBusy);
    ```
4.	In Solution Explorer, double-click **speaker-badge.htm**.
5.	On the **Debug** menu, click **Start Without Debugging**.
6.	In Microsoft Edge, if the message **Intranet settings are turned off by default** appears, click **Don’t show this message again**.
7.	On the Windows taskbar, click **File Explorer**.
8.	Browse to the folder **Allfiles\Mod14\Labfiles\Resources**.
9.	Drag **mark-hanson-large.jpg** from Windows Explorer into Microsoft Edge and drop it onto the canvas with the label **Drag your profile photo here**.
10.	Verify that you cannot scroll the page or move to another page until after the image has been displayed. This may take several seconds.
11.	If Microsoft Edge displays the message **localhost is not responding due to a long-running script**, wait for the message to disappear.
12.	Close Microsoft Edge.

#### Task 3: Create a web worker to perform image processing.

1.	In Visual Studio, in Solution Explorer, in the **scripts** folder, double-click **grayscale.js**
2.	Find the following comment:
    ```javascript
        // TODO: Create a Worker that runs /scripts/grayscale-worker.js
    ```
3.	After this comment, add the following JavsScript code:
    ```javascript
        var worker = new Worker("/scripts/grayscale-worker.js");
        worker.postMessage(imageData);
    ```
4.	In Solution Explorer, in the **scripts** folder, double-click **grayscale-worker.js**.
5.	Add the following JavaScript code to this file, after the comment at the top:
    ```javascript
        addEventListener("message", function (event) {
        
        });
    ```
6.	In Solution Explorer, double-click **grayscale.js**. 
7.	Find the following JavaScript statements:
    ```javascript
        var worker = new Worker("/scripts/grayscale-worker.js");
        worker.postMessage(imageData);
    ```
8.	Insert the following code shown in bold between these two statements:
    ```javascript
        var worker = new Worker("/scripts/grayscale-worker.js");
        var handleMessage = function (event) {
        };
        worker.addEventListener("message", handleMessage.bind(this));
        worker.postMessage(imageData);
    ```

#### Task 4: Move image processing code into the web worker.

1.	In **grayscale.js**, cut the following code that defines the **grayscalePixel** function to the clipboard:
    ```javascript
        var grayscalePixel = function (pixels, index) {
            /// <summary>Updates the pixel, starting at the given index, to be gray scale.</summary>

            var brightness = 0.34 * pixels[index] + 0.5 * pixels[index + 1] + 0.16 * pixels     [index + 2];

            pixels[index] = brightness; // red
            pixels[index + 1] = brightness; // green
            pixels[index + 2] = brightness; // blue
        };
    ```
2.	In **grayscale-worker.js**, underneath the existing code, paste the JavaScript code for the **grayscalePixel** function from the clipboard.
3.	In **grayscale.js**, in the **grayscaleImage()** function, delete the following code:
    ```javascript
        var pixels = imageData.data;
        // 4 array items per pixel => Red, Green, Blue, Alpha
        for (var i = 0; i < pixels.length; i += 4) {
            grayscalePixel(pixels, i);
        }
    ```
4.	In **grayscale-worker.js**, add the following code shown in bold to the 
    ```javascript
        addEventListener statement:
        addEventListener("message", function (event) {
        
            var imageData = event.data;
            var pixels = imageData.data;
            for (var i = 0; i < pixels.length; i += 4) {
                grayscalePixel(pixels, i);
            }
        });
    ```

#### Task 5: Return image data from the web worker.

1.	In **grayscale-worker.js**, after the **for** loop in the **addEventListener** statement, add the following code shown in bold:
    ```javascript
        for (var i = 0; i < pixels.length; i += 4) {
            grayscalePixel(pixels, i);
        }
        postMessage({ done: imageData });
    ```
2.	In **grayscale.js**, in the **grayscaleImage()** function, delete the following code: 
    ```javascript
        // Update the canvas with the gray scaled image data.
        context.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
        context.putImageData(imageData, 0, 0);

        // Returning a jQuery Deferred makes this function easy to chain together with other deferred operations.
        // The canvas object is returned as this can be used like an image.
        deferred.resolveWith(this, [canvas]);
    ```
3.	Find the following JavaScript statement:
    ```javascript
        var handleMessage = function (event) { };
    ```
4.	Add following JavaScript code shown in bold to this statement:
    ```javascript
        var handleMessage = function (event) {
            var message = event.data;
            var updatedImageData = message.done;
            // Update the canvas with the gray scaled image data.
            context.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
            context.putImageData(updatedImageData, 0, 0);
            deferred.resolveWith(this, [canvas]);
        };
    ```

#### Task 6: Test the application.

1.	On the Windows taskbar, click the Microsoft Edge icon.
2.	In Microsoft Edge, press F12.
3.	On the **Cache** menu, click **Clear browser cache**.
4.	In the **Clear Browser Cache** message box, click **Yes**.
5.	Press F12, and then close Microsoft Edge.
6.	In Visual Studio, in Solution Explorer, double-click **speaker-badge.htm**.
7.	On the **Debug** menu, click **Start Without Debugging**.
8.	On the taskbar, click **File Explorer**.
9.	Browse to the **Allfiles\Mod14\Labfiles\Resources** folder.
10.	Drag **mark-hanson-large.jpg** from File Explorer into Microsoft Edge and drop it onto the canvas with the label **Drag your profile photo here**.
11.	Verify that you can scroll the page up and down while and image is being processed.
12.	Close Microsoft Edge.

>**Results:** After completing this exercise, you will have a created a web page that remains responsive while slow image processing code runs in a web worker.
