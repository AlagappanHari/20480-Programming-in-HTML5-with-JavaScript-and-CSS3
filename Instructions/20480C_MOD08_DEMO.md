# Lesson 4: Debugging and Profiling a Web Application

### Demonstration: Using the F12 Developer Tools to Debug JavaScript Code

#### Preparation Steps 

1. Ensure that you have cloned the 20480C directory from GitHub. It contains the code segments for this course's labs and demos. https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/20480-Programming-in-HTML5-with-JavaScript-and-CSS3/tree/get_started/Allfiles.

#### Demonstration Steps

#### Set a Breakpoint in JavaScript code

1.	On the Windows 10 **Start** screen, click the **Desktop** tile.
2.	On the Windows taskbar, click **Microsoft Edge**.
3.	In Microsoft Edge, browse to the file **Allfiles\Mod08\Democode\Document.html**.
4.	If the message **Microsoft Edge restricted this webpage from running scripts or ActiveX controls** appears, click **Allow blocked content**.
5.	Press F12 to display the Developer Tools window.
6.	If the F12 Developer Tools window appears as a pane in Microsoft Edge, in the F12 Developer Tools pane, click **Unpin**.

>**Note:** This action causes the F12 Developer Tools to appear in a standalone window.

7.	In the F12 Developer Tools window, click **Script**.
8.	Click in the margin next to line 12, in order to create a breakpoint on the first statement inside the **onload()** function.

5.	Close the F12 Developer Tools window.
6.	Close Microsoft Edge.
