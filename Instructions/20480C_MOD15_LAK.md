# Lab: Setting Up Webpack Bundle for Production

### Lab Setup

### Preparation Steps

1.	Ensure that you have cloned the 20480C directory from GitHub. It contains the code segments for this course's labs and demos. https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/20480-Programming-in-HTML5-with-JavaScript-and-CSS3/tree/master/Allfiles.

### Exercise 1: Creating Deploy Package Using Webpack.

#### Task 1: Install and configure babel and webpack.

1.	Open **Visual Studio 2017**.
2.	In Visual Studio, on the **File** menu, point to **Open**, and then click **Project/Solution**.
3.	In the **Open Project** dialog box, browse to **Allfiles\Mod15\Labfiles\Starter**, click **ContosoConf.sln**, and then click **Open**.
4.	In Visual Studio, on the **Project** menu, right click **Add New Item**.
5.	In the **Add New Item – ContosoConf** dialog box, click **npm Configuration File**.
6.	In the **Name** box, type **package.json**.
7.	Click **Add**.
8.  Open **CMD** and nevigate to project folder.
9.  To install **babel-core babel-loader babel-preset-es2015 webpack** run the folowing commend in **CMD**:
    ```bash
        npm install babel-core babel-loader babel-preset-es2015 webpack --save-dev
    ```
10. In Visual Studio, on the **Project** menu, right click **Add New Item**.
11. In the **Add New Item – ContosoConf** dialog box, click **JavaScript File**.
12. In the **Name** box, type **webpack.config.js**.
13. In **webpack.config.js** file require packages **page** and **webpack**, store this packages in a variable.
    ```javascript
        var path = require('path');
        var webpack = require('webpack');
    ```
14. Cunfigure **module.export** object with **entry** object that include entry for every javascript file imported in html files.
    ```javascript
        module.exports = {
            entry: {
                video: './scripts/pages/video.js',
                feedback: './scripts/pages/feedback.js',
                live: './scripts/pages/live.js',
                location: './scripts/pages/location.js',
                locationVenue: './scripts/pages/location-venue.js',
                register: './scripts/pages/register.js',
                schedule: './scripts/pages/schedule.js',
                speakerBadge: './scripts/pages/speaker-badge.js',
                offline: './scripts/offline.js'
            },
        }
    ```
15. Add **output** object to **module.export**, cunfigure **path** property to place where to save the **bundel** files, filename property with **name** place holder and **publicPath** with the dist value.
    ```javascript
        output: {
            path: path.resolve(__dirname,'dist'),
            filename: '[name].bundle.js',
            publicPath: '/dist/'
        },
    ```
16. Add **module** object to **module.export**, inside add **rules** array with *babel-loader** configuretion object.
    ```javascript
        module: {
            rules: [
                {
                    test: /\.js$/,

                }
            ]
        },
    ```
17. To **module.export** add the **stats**, **devtool** and **mode** objects.
    ```javascript
        stats: {
            colors: true
        },
        devtool: 'source-map',
        mode: 'production'
    ```

#### Task 2: Create bundel files and replace javascript.

1.  In **CMD** run the folowing commend.
    ```bash
        npm run webpack
    ```
2.  For every html file replace all script **src** to load the new bundel files from **dist** folder, for example:
    ```html
        <script src="/dist/video.bundle.js" type="module"></script>
    ```
3.  Run the application, the application shuled work as before and suppert previous version explorer.

>**Results:** After completing this exercise, you will have a new **bundel.js** files support es5 for older explorer.
